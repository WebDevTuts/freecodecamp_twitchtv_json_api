## Free Code Camp - Use The Twitch.tv JSON API

In this freecodecamp project, we will use Twitch.tv API to display user whether he/she is online or offline. We also want to display people that user has been following, their channel status if they are live or currently streaming. We also will check whether streamers have closed their Twitch account.
